N=17 (vehicle and MRT-6160) or 8 (fingolimod).\n\nSummary and Future Development\n\n• MRT-6160 is a first-in-class selective VAV1 molecular glue degrader with oral bioavailability.\n• Degradation of VAV1 inhibits T and B cell activation and cytokine production and inhibits B \n\ncell differentiation into plasmablasts and subsequent IgG production.\n\n• Oral  administration  of  MRT-6160  inhibits  EAE  disease  progression,  severity,  and  incidence \nconcomitant with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the spinal cord and reduced \nspinal cord immune cell infiltration and demyelination.\n\n• MRT-6160 reduces expression of T cell activation and pro-inflammatory genes in the spinal \n\ncords of EAE mice.\n\n• Given  its in vivo  efficacy  and  MOA  profile,  these  data  suggest  that  MRT-6160  has  strong \npotential  to  alleviate  disease  symptoms  in  lymphocyte-mediated  autoimmune  and \ninflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple \nsclerosis, and psoriasis.\n\n• MRT-6160  is  currently  being  tested  in  Healthy  Subjects  (NCT06597799).    Monte  Rosa \nTherapeutics has a global exclusive license agreement with Novartis to advance VAV1 MGDs \nincluding MRT-6160.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the in vivo EAE  study,  spinal  cords  were  excised  and  assessed  by  hemolysin  and  eosin  (left micrograph)  or  Fast  Blue  (right micrograph)  for  immune  cell  infiltration  and  demyelination/lesion  area  (%)  respectively;  indicated  by  arrows  in \nrespective micrographs. Graph shows total histopathological score comprising the sum of histopathological scoring for immune cell infiltration, demyelination, and lesion area (%). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s \nmultiple comparisons vs. vehicle. ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. N=16.\n\nMRT-6160 reduces expression of T cell activation and \ndifferentiation gene sets in the spinal cord\n\nAt the end of the in vivo EAE study, spinal cords were excised, digested, and assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Analysis revealed downregulation of key genes involved in T-cell signalling in the MRT-6160-treated subgroup compared to \nthe vehicle group, particularly within the T-cell subset.

Graphs show disease scores over time (upper left), disease scores on Day 20 (upper middle), disease score area under the curve (AUC) (upper right), \nbody weight change over time (lower left), and disease incidence (lower right). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons vs. vehicle. **p<0.01, ****p<0.0001. \nN=16 (vehicle and MRT-6160) or N=8 (fingolimod).\n\nMRT-6160 reduces spinal cord levels of pro-inflammatory \ncytokines associated with multiple sclerosis\n\nAt the end of the in vivo EAE study, spinal cords were excised, homogenised, and cytokine levels were assessed by MSD. Graphs show indicated cytokine levels. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way \nANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons vs. vehicle. ns = not significant, *p<0.05, **p<0.01,***p<0.001. N=7-8.\n\nAt the end of the in vivo EAE study, spinal cords were excised, digested, and assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). UMAP clustering was filtered on CD3-expressing cells (upper left). Graph shows percentage of cells expressing indicated genes \nacross T cells in vehicle and MRT-6160-treated groups (lower left). Pathway enrichment analysis showing top pathways up- or down-modulated by MRT-6160 (right). \n\nSummary and Future Development\n\n• MRT-6160 is a first-in-class selective VAV1 molecular glue degrader with oral bioavailability\n• Degradation of VAV1 inhibits T and B cell activation and effector functions \n• Oral administration of MRT-6160 inhibits EAE disease progression, severity, and incidence\n• Concomitant with disease scores, MRT-6160 reduced T cell activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression \n\nin the spinal cords of EAE mice \n\n• MRT-6160-treated  EAE  mice  showed  reduced  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  levels,  immune  cell  infiltration,  and \n\n• These data demonstrate that MRT-6160 inhibits EAE disease progression through reduction of T and B cell function\n• Preclinical in vivo efficacy  and  MOA  data  suggest  that  MRT-6160  has  the  potential  to  treat  multiple  lymphocyte-\nmediated  autoimmune  and  inflammatory  diseases  including  multiple  sclerosis,  inflammatory  bowel  disease, \nrheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, among others\n\n• MRT-6160 has completed testing in Healthy Subjects (NCT06597799)\n• Monte Rosa Therapeutics has a global exclusive license agreement with Novartis to advance VAV1 MGDs including \n\ndemyelination within the spinal cord\n\nMRT-6160\n\nReferences: 1.

The  y-axis represents p-\nvalue [-log10]; the x-axis represents protein fold change [log2] relative to DMSO (0.1%) control samples. Dark blue circles represent CRBN neosubstrates including the target, \nVAV1, and other known cereblon  neosubstrates; GSPT1,  IKZF1, IKZF3, CSNK1A1 (CK1a), SALL4, and ZFP91. Purple  circles represent VAV family  members VAV2 and VAV3. \n\nColons were excised from mice at termination and stored in RNAlater. RNA was extracted from colon samples and quality was assessed by NanoDrop and Qubit. Gene counts were performing using the NanoString Autoimmune Profiling Panel and \nprocessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Background signal was determined at twice the SD above the mean of the negative control. Data were normalized to 8 housekeeping genes and median of the ratio was used. Graphs show  \ndifferentially  expressed genes (DEG) in MRT-6160  vs vehicle treated mice. Table shows log2 fold change, p-value,  and description of labelled  genes in volcano  plot.\n\n• MRT-6160 is a development candidate currently in IND-enabling studies.\n\nReferences: 1.

Neurath\n\n1 and Leslie J. Berg\n\n2,*\n\nThe guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) VAV1, a previously ‘undruggable’\nprotein integral to T/B lymphocyte antigen–receptor signaling, promotes actin poly-\nmerization, immunological synapse formation, T cell activation and differentiation,\nand cytokine production. With the development of novel modalities for targeting\nproteins, we hypothesize that interventions targeting VAV1 will have therapeutic po-\ntential in T and T/B cell-mediated autoimmune and chronic inﬂammatory diseases.\nThis opinion is supported by recent CRISPR-Cas9 studies showing VAV1 as a key\npositive regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) activation and cytokine production in pri-\nmary human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; data demonstrating that loss/suppression of\nVAV1 regulates autoimmunity and inﬂammation; and promising preclinical data\nfrom T and T/B cell-mediated disease models of arthritis and colitis showing the ef-\nfectiveness of selective VAV1 targeting via protein degradation.\n\nVAV1: new options for targeting a previously ‘undruggable’ immune target\nTargeted therapies, including biologic therapies (see Glossary) and small-molecule inhibitors, are\nnow standard of care for many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Despite ad-\nvances over the past 25 years, considerable unmet needs remain, including treatment failure, drug\nsafety/tolerability, glucocorticoid dependency, and a lack of targeted therapies for certain condi-\ntions. In the autoimmune and chronic inﬂammatory disease treatment landscape, oral small mole-\ncules, which largely target intracellular protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as Janus kinases [1],\npresent certain advantages over injectable biologics, including penetration of the cell membrane,\nlow immunogenicity, and convenient administration. Many other intracellular proteins, such as\nthose lacking a targetable (active/allosteric) binding site or that work through protein–protein/\nDNA interactions, might represent clinically interesting targets but have classically been considered\n‘undruggable’ [2]. One such molecule is VAV1, a multidomain protein with a dual function as both a\nGEF and a scaffolding protein involved in GEF-independent signaling pathways [3].\n\nVav1–/– mouse data suggest a key role for VAV1 in T/B lymphocyte function and antigen–receptor\nsignaling, particularly in T cells [4,5]. Recently, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening identiﬁed\nVAV1 as a key positive regulator of T cell activation/function in human Jurkat T cells and primary\nhuman CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, all of which are receptive to TCR-mediated signaling [6–8], potentially\nrendering it a useful target in certain human immune-mediated diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis\n(RA), inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). While VAV1 is crucial for thymo-\ncyte development [4,5], we focus here on its role in mediating TCR and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling\nin mature T/B cells, because disruption of VAV1 GEF-dependent/independent signaling pathways in\neffector lymphocytes in an adult immune system is likely more relevant to VAV1 as a potential thera-\npeutic target. We also consider what is known about VAV1 in autoimmune/inﬂammatory disease\n\nHighlights\nMammalian dual-function guanine\nnucleotide exchange factor\n(GEF)\nVAV1 regulates T/B cell receptor sig-\nnaling, T cell activation, T helper cell\ndifferentiation, cytokine production,\nactin polymerization, and cytoskeleton\nreorganization via GEF-dependent and\n-independent pathways.\n\nRecent CRISPR-Cas9 screening data\nand animal models (e.g., rodent) of auto-\nimmune and chronic inﬂammatory dis-\nease conﬁrm VAV1 as a positive T cell\nregulator and support its potential as a\ncandidate therapeutic target in T and T/\nB cell-mediated diseases.\n\nTo date, VAV1 has been considered\n‘undruggable’. Directly targeting GEF\ndomains is challenging, and approaches\nto inhibit GEF activity, leaving scaffolding\nfunctions intact, may lead to inadequate\nattenuation of VAV1 activity.\n\nPreclinical studies exploring a new modal-\nity of attenuating the dual function of\nVAV1 through protein degradation show\npromise in animal models of some auto-\nimmune/inﬂammatory diseases.\n\nSigniﬁcance\nDespite the availability of multiple\nadvanced targeted biologics and oral\nsmall molecules\nto treat certain\nautoimmune and chronic inﬂammatory\ndiseases, considerable unmet needs\nremain, prompting the search for new\ndrug targets. Novel mechanisms of\naction that target the dual catalytic and\nscaffolding functions of the GEF VAV1\nmight optimally ‘drug’ VAV1 and,\ntherefore, have broad therapeutic\npotential\nin T and T/B cell-mediated\ndiseases.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

The protein structure of VAV1 has been reviewed previously [3,10]. However, the\nmultidomain structure of VAV1 is critical to its activation and function, with different domains regu-\nlating VAV1 GEF-dependent and -independent activity and subsequent downstream signaling [3].\n\n1Department of Medicine, 1 & Deutsches\nZentrum Immuntherapie, University of\nErlangen-Nürnberg, Kussmaul Campus\nfor Medical Research, 91054 Erlangen,\nGermany\n2Department of Immunology &\nMicrobiology, University of Colorado\nAnschutz School of Medicine, Aurora,\nCO 80045, USA\n\n*Correspondence:\nLeslie.Berg@cuanschutz.edu (L.J. Berg).\n\nRegulation of VAV1 activity\nLymphocyte activation through the TCR and BCR leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of\nVAV1, releasing intrinsic autoinhibition of the protein [3]. Recent in vitro analyses in human Jurkat\nT cells showed that VAV1 activation is inﬂuenced by multiple upstream PTKs and scaffolding pro-\nteins and complex phosphorylation dynamics involving multiple tyrosine residues on different\nVAV1 domains, which may differentially regulate its catalytic and noncatalytic functions [11,12].\nFor example, in T cells, transmembrane linker for activation in T cells (LAT) and Src homology\n(SH)2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP76) form a key scaffold for VAV1, facil-\nitating its proximity to receptor-associated PTKs (Figure 1) [13].

The role of VAV1 in antigen receptor signaling. VAV1 is a key component of antigen–receptor signaling complexes associated with (A) the T cell receptor\n(TCR)/CD3 (reviewed in [13]) and (B) B cell receptor (BCR; reviewed in [14]). In T cells, Src homology (SH)2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP76) is\nrecruited to transmembrane linker for activation in T cells (LAT) via its SH2 domain and the LAT/SLP76 complex acts as a critical scaffold for other proteins in the TCR\nproximal signaling complex, including VAV1. VAV1 interacts with other proteins via SH2 and proline-rich-region/SH3 domains [122–125]. In B cells, VAV1 interacts in a\nlinker), Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), Grb2, and\nsignaling complex that includes a scaffolding protein homologous to SLP76, SLP65 (also known as B cell\nphospholipase-gamma (PLCγ)2 [32,118,126]. Assembly of these protein complexes activates downstream events, including phosphorylation of PLCγ1/2; activation of\nsignaling pathways mediated by Ca2+, protein kinase C (PKC), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); and regulation of transcription factors, including nuclear\nfactor of activated T-cells (NFAT), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) [13]. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-independent\n‘scaffolding’ functions of VAV1 appear to depend on its participation in these antigen receptor–proximal signaling complexes. The primary GEF-dependent function of\nVAV1 is to activate Rac/Rho family GTPases [26]. In both T and B cells, co-stimulation through CD28 and CD19, respectively, are crucial for optimal phosphorylation of\nVAV1 and activation of downstream signaling pathways [3]. The exact mechanism for co-receptor activation of VAV1 remains to be fully determined.\n\n2\n\nTrends in Immunology, Month 2024, Vol. xx, No. xx"

Co-stimulation of T and B cells through CD28 and\nCD19, respectively, is also essential for optimal activation of VAV1 [3].\n\nTarget validation in human T cells\nOur understanding of VAV1 function (Box 1) derives largely from older studies in knockout mice\n(phenotypes are reviewed extensively elsewhere [3]). Vav1–/– mice have severe T cell develop-\nmental defects, including signiﬁcant reductions in thymocyte and peripheral T cell numbers\n[4,5]. They also show functional defects in mature T/B cells, such as impaired TCR/BCR signaling\n(Box 1), and in other hematopoietic lineages (neutrophils, NK cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells),\nincluding crawling/migration defects in neutrophils [3]. Although Vav1–/– germline knockouts have\nsome utility, defects in thymocyte development may disrupt normal function of adult T cells to the\nextent that they obscure the role of VAV1 in mediating T/B cell function in mature effector lympho-\ncytes. Furthermore, there are no inducible Vav1 knockouts to better mimic the therapeutic\ntargeting of VAV1, and the ‘undruggable’ nature of VAV1 has limited investigation of complete\nfunctional attenuation of the protein in adult mice.\n\nThese limitations, together with possible interspecies differences, restrict our ability to predict the\noutcome of therapeutically targeting VAV1 in humans. However, VAV1-deﬁcient human Jurkat T\ncells (J.Vav1) demonstrate defective TCR signaling, shown via impairment of Ca2+ mobilization\nand interleukin (IL)-2 upregulation [15], supporting the importance of VAV1 in human T cells.\nMoreover, unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screens identiﬁed VAV1 as a key\n\nBox 1. Key defects in Vav1–/– T and B lymphocytes\nT lymphocytes\nVav1–/– mice exhibit severe T cell developmental defects with signiﬁcant reductions in the number of CD4+/CD8+ double-\npositive thymocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive thymocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive peripheral\nsplenic T cells [4,5]. By contrast, T cell development is normal in Vav2–/– [110], Vav3–/–, and Vav2–/–/3–/– knockouts\n[5], suggesting a critical, nonredundant role for Vav1 in T cells, although loss of Vav3 exacerbates the Vav1–/– pheno-\ntype [5]. Vav1–/– mice also demonstrate impaired production of IL-2 and T cell proliferation following activation through\nthe TCR complex [4,5].\n\nIn response to TCR/CD28 co-stimulation, Vav1–/– CD4+ Th cells show deﬁcient expression of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 (but\nnot IL-5/IL-13) and c-Maf, a Th2-speciﬁc transcription factor that regulates IL-4 expression [108]. By contrast, expression\nof the Th1 cytokine IFNγ and Th1-speciﬁc transcription factor T-bet are enhanced even under Th2 polarizing conditions\n[108].\n\nMultiple defects in TCR-mediated signaling in Vav1-deﬁcient T-cells have been reported, including Ca2+ mobilization\n[4,15,17], PLCγ1 phosphorylation [17], inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production [17], activation of Tec family kinases Akt\nand Itk [17], mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation [18], actin reorganization, F-actin polymerization,\nand TCR clustering [4,5], formation of peptide-speciﬁc conjugates with APCs, and activation of integrin lymphocyte\nfunction-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) [27,28].\n\nVav1-deﬁcient T cells demonstrate impaired activation of certain transcription factors, including NFAT, nuclear factor-\nkappa B (NF-κB), and activator protein-1 (AP-1), all of which regulate the Il2 promoter [4,15].\n\nB lymphocytes\nVav1–/– mice have normal numbers of pro-B, pre-B, and immature B cells in the bone marrow and mature splenic and\nlymph node B cells, although severely reduced numbers of innate-like B-1a cells in the peritoneal cavity are reported\n[4,5]. While B cell development appears to be relatively normal, Vav1–/– mice display defects in T cell-dependent B cell re-\nsponses, immunoglobulin (Ig)G1/2b/3 class switching, BCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, and B cell proliferation in periph-\neral B cells, even when recombinant IL-4 is added [5,110].\n\nWhile Vav1–/– mice do not present developmental defects in the B cell compartment, Vav1 deﬁciency exacerbates B cell\ndevelopmental defects in mice lacking Btk, a key component of BCR signaling. Compared with Btk–/– single knockouts,\nVav1–/–Btk–/– double-knockout mice exhibit more severe reductions in mature splenic B cells, IgM production, IgG class\nswitching, Ca2+ mobilization, and B cell proliferation [121].\n\nOPEN ACCESS\n\nGlossary\nActin reorganization and F-actin\npolymerization: reversible process in\nwhich actin monomers assemble into an\nactin nucleus followed by elongation,\nwhere additional monomers are rapidly\nadded to each end of the actin nucleus\nto form an actin ‘ﬁlament’.\nAutoimmune and chronic\ninflammatory diseases:\nheterogenous spectrum of disorders\ncharacterized by loss of self-tolerance,\nchronic tissue-speciﬁc and systemic\ninﬂammation, and long-term tissue\ndamage.\nBiologic therapy: treatments derived\nfrom living organisms (e.g., vaccines,\nproteins); in this case, monoclonal\nantibodies or antibody fragments that act\non circulating cytokines and cell surface\nreceptors of the immune system.\nCommon variable\nimmunodeficiency (CVID): rare\ncondition characterized by\nhypogammaglobulinemia secondary to\nT cell abnormalities (T-CVID).\nDiapedesis: migration of cells across\nthe vascular wall into target tissues.\nDrug retention rate: percentage of\npatients remaining on treatment over\ntime.\nGEF ‘trap’ assay: in vitro assay in\nVAV1-deﬁcient Jurkat T cells transfected\nwith ﬂuorescent-tagged SLP76,\ndominant-negative Rac/Rho GTPases,\nand VAV GEFs; used to visualize the co-\nlocalization of different Rac/Rho\nGTPases with physiologically activated\nVAV isoforms in SLP76 clusters in intact\ncells using confocal microscopy.\nGuanine nucleotide exchange\nfactor (GEF): promotes the exchange\nof GDP for GTP on downstream target\nRac/Rho GTPases, switching them from\nan inactive (GDP-bound) to an active\n(GTP-bound) state.\nImmunological synapse: stable\ninterface between lymphocytes\n(e.g., T cells) and target cells (e.g.,\nAPCs), including receptors responsible\nfor adhesion and signal transduction;\nrequires actin polymerization and\ncytoskeleton reorganization to form.\nIntegrins: transmembrane proteins\ninvolved in the adhesion of cells to each\nother or to the extracellular matrix.\nInterleukin (IL)-2: pleiotropic cytokine\ncrucial to the differentiation and\nregulation of proinﬂammatory and anti-\ninﬂammatory T cells.\nNuclear factor of activated T-cells\n(NFAT): transcription factor family\n\nTrends in Immunology, Month 2024, Vol. xx, No. xx\n\n3"

Speciﬁcally, genome-scale perturbation dem-\nonstrated that loss of VAV1 prevented: (i) TCR-mediated activation in Jurkat T cells, as measured\nby upregulation of CD69 [8], a classical early lymphocyte activation marker and key surface pro-\ntein involved in activated T cell egress from the lymph nodes [16]; (ii) TCR-mediated cytokine se-\ncretion, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFNγ), in primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,\nrespectively [6]; and (iii) TCR-mediated T cell proliferation [7]. Taken together, these data further\nvalidate the importance of VAV1 in TCR-mediated activation and T cell effector function.\n\nGEF-independent (scaffolding) functions\nMouse Vav1–/– thymocytes and splenic T-cells and human J.Vav1 T-cells show multiple defects\nin TCR-mediated signaling, e.g. impaired Ca2+ mobilization and transcription factor activation\n(Box 1) [4,15,17,18]. Considering its participation in the TCR complex, much of this activity likely\ndepends on the scaffolding function of VAV1 (Figure 1) [17–19]. For example, lymph node T cells\nisolated from mice expressing GEF-inactive Vav1 (Vav1L334A/K335A or Vav1AA/AA) showed normal\nTCR-mediated Ca2+ ﬂux and activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) in vitro\n[20]. Conversely, human VAV1-deﬁcient J.Vav1 T cells transfected with VAV1 N-terminal trunca-\ntion mutants that retain GEF activity did not interact with phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ)1 and\nshowed defective downstream Ca2+ mobilization [21], calmodulin binding, and NFAT activation\nin vitro [22]. Similarly, biochemical data showed impaired downstream phosphorylation of\nPLCγ1 in T cell lines deﬁcient in the scaffolding proteins LAT, SLP76, or Tec family kinase ITK\n[23–25]. Together, these data suggest that loss/dysfunction of any of these scaffolding proteins,\nincluding VAV1, destabilizes the TCR proximal signaling complex, disrupting downstream events,\nsuch as the activation of PLCγ1-dependent pathways.\n\nGEF-dependent (catalytic) functions\nThe downstream effects of the primary GEF-dependent function of VAV1 (to activate Rac/Rho\nGTPases [26]) include actin reorganization and F-actin polymerization, TCR clustering\n[4,5], activation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, immunological synapse formation be-\ntween T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [27–29], and chemokine-mediated cell migra-\ntion [30,31]. VAV1 also regulates cytoskeletal reorganization in B cells [32].\n\nContrary to the historical belief that VAV1 activates multiple Rac/Rho GTPases, most biochemical\ndata suggest that VAV1 preferentially acts as a GEF for Rac1, with limited activation of other Rac/\nRho family members, including RhoA, Cdc42, and Ras [11,26,33]. In vitro nucleotide-\nexchange assays showed that VAV1 mediates activation of Rac1 by an order of magnitude\ngreater than its activation of RhoA or Cdc42 [33]. Therefore, it is likely that VAV1 does not bind\nwith high afﬁnity to GTPases other than Rac1. Indeed, a recent study using a novel in vitro GEF\n‘trap’ assay showed obvious co-localization of VAV1 with Rac1 but not with any other GTPases,\nwhereas VAV2 co-localized with a much broader range of GTPases, including Rac2, RhoG, and\nCdc42 [34], supporting the notion that VAV1 preferentially activates Rac1.\n\nActin polymerization and cytoskeleton remodeling are necessary for many of the key functions of\nT lymphocytes, including immunological synapse formation, integrin-mediated adhesion, chemo-\nkine responses, cell migration, and extravasation into peripheral tissues [35]. The importance of\nRac1 in actin polymerization is evidenced by GEF-dependent actin defects in Vav1–/– mice,\nwhich are sufﬁcient to block thymocyte development [4,5]. Furthermore, mice expressing the\nVav1AA/AA GEF-inactive form demonstrated severely impaired Rac1 activation, actin polymeriza-\ntion, T cell–APC conjugate formation, and integrin activation [20]. Moreover, reconstitution of\nVav1–/– mice with a constitutively active Rac1 mutant, but not a RhoA mutant, overcame their thy-\nmocyte developmental block, restoring pre-T cell differentiation and thymocyte numbers, thereby\n\n4\n\nTrends in Immunology, Month 2024, Vol. xx, No. xx\n\ninvolved in TCR-mediated early gene\ntranscription (e.g., IL2).\nNucleotide-exchange assay: in vitro\nsystem using puriﬁed, crystallized\ncomplexes of VAV1 fragments\ncontaining the VAV1 catalytic GEF\ndomains and Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA\nGTPases; assesses the rate of VAV1-\nmediated GDP-GTP exchange on Rac/\nRho proteins using ﬂuorescence\nspectroscopy.\nPrimary treatment failure: lack of\nresponse (i.e., persistent signs and\nsymptoms of disease) despite drug\ntreatment.\nProteolysis-targeting chimera\n(PROTAC) degraders: small molecules\ncomprising two ligands joined by a linker\nmolecule; one ligand recruits the target\nprotein by binding to a distinct binding\npocket and the second recruits and binds\nE3 ubiquitin ligase leading to ubiquitination\nof the target and its subsequent removal\nfrom the cell using the ubiquitin-\nproteosome system of the body.\nRegulatory T cells (Tregs): subset of\nCD4+ Th cells characterized by the\nproduction of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines\n(e.g., IL-10 and TGFβ) and expression of\nthe Treg-speciﬁc transcription factor\nFoxP3; involved in immunosuppression\nand immune tolerance.\nSecondary treatment failure: loss of\nresponse to drug treatment over time.\nT cell polarization: in response to\nactivating stimuli, such as antigen\nbinding of the TCR, T cells undergo rapid\nreorganization of the actin cytoskeleton\nto form distinct ‘poles’ (e.g., the\nimmunological synapse at one end of\nthe cell and the distal-pole complex, a\ncomplex of other cell-surface receptors,\nat the opposite side of the cell).\nT cell receptor (TCR) clustering:\nfollowing T cell activation through\nantigen receptor binding, multiple TCR\nmolecules cluster at the cell membrane\nat the center of the immunological\nsynapse.\nT helper (Th) 1 cells: CD4+ Th cell\nsubset characterized by the production\nof proinﬂammatory Th1 cytokine IFNγ\nand expression of Th1-speciﬁc\ntranscription factor Tbet; involved in type\n1 immune responses (intracellular\nbacteria/protozoa/viruses) and\nautoimmunity.\nT helper (Th) 2 cells: CD4+ Th cell\nsubset characterized by the production\nof proinﬂammatory Th2 cytokines IL-4,\nIL-5, and IL-13, and expression of Th2-\nspeciﬁc transcription factors GATA3 and\nc-Maf; involved in type 2 immune"

For instance, CXCL12 promotes actin polymerization, T cell\npolarization, and cell migration, events that were blocked in vitro by a dominant-negative form of\nVAV1 (VAV1L213Q) overexpressed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) [31]. In vitro ev-\nidence also indicates that CXCL12-mediated integrin activation in PBLs is dependent on VAV1-\ndependent activation of Rac1 [29].\n\nGiven the importance of Rac1 to actin polymerization, if, as we hypothesize, VAV1 preferentially\nmediates its GEF function through Rac1 activation in response to TCR signaling, then many of\nthe major defects observed in VAV1-deﬁcient T cells, including in immunological synapse forma-\ntion, integrin adhesion, and cell migration, might be attributable to deﬁciencies in actin polymeri-\nzation and cytoskeleton remodeling (Figure 2).\n\nVAV1 in autoimmune and chronic inﬂammatory diseases\nAlthough its precise role in human disease remains to be clinically validated, multiple lines of ev-\nidence implicate VAV1 in autoimmune and chronic inﬂammatory diseases (Table 1 [40–71]),\nsupporting its candidacy as a putative therapeutic target.\n\nVAV1 expression and pathway activation\nFew studies have directly evaluated VAV1 expression in humans and the signiﬁcance of its ex-\npression levels is unclear. For example, compared with healthy controls, VAV1 mRNA was in-\ncreased in immune cells of the inﬂamed gut mucosa from patients with IBD [63] and in skin\nbiopsies from patients with psoriasis [69], but was signiﬁcantly reduced in peripheral blood mono-\nnuclear cells from patients with MS [47]. Given that VAV1 is ubiquitously expressed across im-\nmune cells, its downstream functions may not be regulated by the extent of VAV1 expression.\nRather, VAV1 phosphorylation and subsequent pathway activation following TCR ligation may\nbe a better indication of VAV1 activity and pathogenic function in diseased tissues.\n\nVAV1 gene variants\nRelative to wild-type (WT), rodents harboring the Vav1R63W variant exhibit reduced susceptibility to\nexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [51,54] and pristane-induced arthritis [43]. This\nvariant, which is associated with reduced VAV1 scaffolding functions (Ca2+ mobilization) but normal\n[51] or even hyperactive [72] GEF activity, is also associated with increased numbers of anti-\ninﬂammatory CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in blood, lymph nodes, and spleen, relative\nto WT [72], as well as reduced IFNγ and IL-17A production by autoreactive CD4+ T cells [51]. These\ndata suggest that GEF-independent functions are important for VAV1-mediated inﬂammation and\nproinﬂammatory cytokine production. Moreover, Vav1R63WThemis-T–/– mice, which carry both the\nVav1R63W variant and a T cell-conditional knockout of Themis (a gene required for T cell develop-\nment and effector functions [73]), exhibit pronounced attenuation of EAE symptoms [including re-\nduced IFNγ, IL-17A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production and T cell inﬁltration of the central\nnervous system (CNS)] compared with either variant alone [50]. Given that Themis associates with\nthe TCR and enhances TCR signaling, as evidenced from reduced NFAT nuclear translocation in\nThemis–/– CD4+ T cells [73], the reduced susceptibility to EAE in Vav1R63WThemis-T–/– mice versus\nVav1R63W mice suggests cooperativity between VAV1 and other TCR-associated proteins in auto-\nimmune pathogenesis. Somewhat paradoxically, Vav1R63W is also linked to increased susceptibility\nto IBD in rats [64] and myasthenia gravis in mice [66].\n\nTrends in Immunology, Month 2024, Vol. xx, No. xx\n\n5"

Activation of VAV1 in\nresponse to stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR), co-stimulation through their\ncorresponding co-receptors CD28 and CD19, respectively, or through chemokine receptors promotes the exchange of GDP\nfor GTP on downstream target Rac/Rho family GTPases, switching them from an inactive (GDP-bound) to active (GTP-\nbound) state. Historically, it has been suggested that VAV1 activates multiple Rac/Rho GTPases. However, available\nbiochemical data suggest that VAV1 preferentially acts as a GEF for Rac1, with limited activation of other family members,\nincluding RhoA, Cdc42, or Ras [11,26,33]. Rac1 activation downstream of VAV1 is essential for actin reorganization, F-actin\npolymerization, and cytoskeleton remodeling [4,5,20,36], which is in turn pivotal for many of the key functions of T\nlymphocytes, including formation of the immunological synapse, integrin-mediated cell adhesion, chemokine responses, cell\nmigration, and extravasation into secondary lymphoid organs and other peripheral tissues [35].

In a zymosan A-induced arthritis model, disease progression (joint swelling and hyperplasia)\nwas observed in both Vav1–/– and WT mice [40], whereas, in a K/BxN serum-transfer model of ar-\nthritis, Vav1–/– mice were protected against inﬂammation, bone erosion, and neutrophil inﬁltration of\nthe joint compared with WT mice [46].\n\nFurthermore, compared with WT mice, Vav1–/– mice were resistant to myelin oligodendrocyte\nglycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE due to impaired priming and expansion of antigen-speciﬁc\nCD4+ and CD8+ lymph node T cells [49]. Similar to the AIA model, production of IL-2, IL-4, and\nIFNγ was impaired in MOG-induced Vav1–/– mice, but not in WT mice, although APC function\nand migration of T cells/macrophages into the CNS were normal [49], again suggesting a role\nfor VAV1 in T cell priming and differentiation, as well as expansion of T helper (Th) cells subsets.\nWhile genetic attenuation of VAV1 appears to suppress autoimmune/inﬂammatory disease activ-\nity and ameliorate disease progression and structural damage, it is not possible to draw deﬁnitive\nconclusions, and these animal data remain to be rigorously validated in human diseases.\n\nThe evolving need for new treatments in autoimmune/inﬂammatory diseases\nThe development of targeted therapies was a major milestone in improving treatment for certain\nautoimmune and chronic inﬂammatory diseases, including IBD, RA, spondyloarthritis, and psori-\natic disorders. Multiple highly efﬁcacious drugs with different mechanisms of action (MOA) are\nnow available for many conditions (Figure 3) [74–76].\n\nAlthough drug retention rates vary by MOA and disease indication, primary and secondary\ntreatment failure are the most common reasons for switching therapy [77–81], exacerbated\nby comorbidities [77,79]. Moreover, management of conditions such as systemic lupus erythe-\nmatosus (SLE) relies heavily on older therapies and is associated with chronic glucocorticoid tox-\nicity, persistent disease activity, cumulative organ damage, and poor long-term survival [82].\nPositive clinical trial data have been reported for the biologics belimumab [83] and anifrolumab\n[84] (which target BlyS/BAFF and IFNα/β, respectively) and both were recently approved by the\nUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment\nof SLE. Additionally, positive clinical trial data in SLE have recently been reported for the oral TYK2\ninhibitor deucravacitinib [85]. Despite such progress, a substantial unmet need remains for addi-\ntional enhanced targeted therapies in SLE [82] and other conditions, including rheumatological\ndisorders [86,87] and IBD [88].\n\nTreatment guidelines for many conditions recommend that glucocorticoids be used only at the low-\nest effective dose as short-term, adjunctive therapy, and are tapered or discontinued when clinically\nfeasible [89–92]. Nevertheless, despite the wide availability of targeted therapies and considerable,\noften severe, side effects that affect multiple organs [93], glucocorticoids are still widely used to man-\nage refractory disease [82,94]. Although relatively safe [76,95,96], many immunomodulators, includ-\ning biologics (e.g., TNF and IL-6 blockers) and oral JAK inhibitors, have shown an increased risk of\ninfections, including serious and opportunistic infections [76,95,96]. Certain infections, such as her-\npes zoster, TB reactivation, and candidiasis, are associated with speciﬁc drug classes, namely, JAK\ninhibitors [95,96], TNF blockers [95,96], and IL-17 blockers, respectively [97]. Thus, the risk of infec-\ntion must be considered with any new immunomodulatory agent.\n\nIn mice, both Vav1 and Btk have been implicated in Dectin-1-mediated macrophage phagocyto-\nsis of Candida albicans and Btk–/– and Vav1–/– mice appear more susceptible to C. albicans infec-\ntion compared with WT mice [98]. Furthermore, in a small number of patients, low VAV1\nexpression was putatively linked to common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [99–101].\n\n10\n\nTrends in Immunology, Month 2024, Vol. xx, No. xx"

Addition-\nally, recent studies indicate the therapeutic potential of combining advanced targeted therapies.\nFor example, the Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, controlled VEGA trial (NCT03662542ii) in pa-\ntients with ulcerative colitis reported a higher clinical response at Week 12 (primary endpoint;\nintention-to-treat analysis) and similar safety outcomes in response to combined therapy with the\nTNF blocker golimumab plus the IL-23-p19 blocker guselkumab versus either treatment alone\n[103].

(A) Lymph node priming and T helper (Th) cell differentiation. VAV1 is a positive regulator of both T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. VAV1\nfacilitates T cell–antigen presenting cell (APC) conjugate formation (i.e., formation of the immunological synapse), TCR-mediated T cell activation, interleukin (IL)-2\nproduction [4–6,109], differentiation of CD4+ Th cell subsets, and production of subset-speciﬁc proinﬂammatory cytokines [108]. (B) Trafﬁcking and transmigration of cells.\nThe primary function of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of VAV1, at least in T cells, appears to be the activation of the Rac1 small GTPase\n[11,26,33], which regulates downstream actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for immunological synapse formation, integrin-mediated cell\nadhesion, cell migration, and diapedesis (i.e., migration across the vascular endothelium into target tissues) [35].

Many drugs, the effect of which\nis based on blocking a single protein\n(e.g., anti-TNF or anti-IL-17A agents) or\nsignaling pathway (e.g., JAK inhibitors),\nshow insufﬁcient efﬁcacy and/or are as-\nsociated with side effects.\n\nInnovative therapeutic approaches\nthat are targeted, yet able to block\nseveral proinﬂammatory mediators\nsimultaneously, would be useful\nadditions\ntherapeutic\narmamentarium, having the potential to\nbreak through the ‘therapeutic ceiling’ in\nthe treatment of autoimmune and\nchronic inﬂammatory diseases.\n\nthe\n\nto\n\nTargeted agents that block both GEF-\ndependent and -independent func-\ntions of VAV1 have the potential to\nblock multiple processes relevant to\nautoimmune inﬂammatory responses,\nincluding activation of cells of both the\nadaptive and innate immune systems,\nformation of immunological synapses\nbetween T cells and APCs, and migra-\ntion of immune cells to inﬂamed tissue.\n\nPreclinical data in animal model\nsystems for arthritis and colitis\nshow that inactivation of VAV1 can\nattenuate certain autoimmune and\nchronic inﬂammatory processes.\n\nNew data suggest that it might be\npossible to inhibit the expression or\nfunction of VAV1 using therapeutic\napproaches including RNA interfer-\nence, designer thiopurine analogs, and\nmolecular glue degrader strategies.\n\nTrends in Immunology\n\nVAV1 as a putative therapeutic target\nConsidering that VAV1 expression is highly restricted to hematopoietic cells, we postulate that\ninterventions targeting VAV1 could directly impact proinﬂammatory responses while avoiding\ncollateral damage to non-immune cells, as reported with other T cell modulators (e.g., azathi-\noprine and calcineurin inhibitors) [104,105]. Azathioprine, an immunosuppressant used for de-\ncades to treat certain autoimmune diseases and chronic inﬂammation, such as Crohn’s\ndisease, broadly establishes the precedent of targeting VAV1/Rac1 signaling. For instance,\nin vitro, the azathioprine metabolite 6-Thio-GTP bound recombinant Rac1 and suppressed\nRac1 activation in isolated primary human CD4+ T cells from healthy volunteers [106]. Further-\nmore, azathioprine (and its metabolites/analogs) has been shown to induce signiﬁcant apopto-\nsis of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from patients with Crohn’s disease, mediated through\nbinding of its metabolite 6-Thio-GTP to Rac1 [63,107]. Of note, as a purine analog, azathio-\nprine may interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis, presenting liabilities that may be avoided\nwith more VAV1-selective therapies.\n\nFigure 4 (Key ﬁgure) proposes a model for three areas of adaptive immunity where VAV1 is essen-\ntial and where targeting it might successfully regulate an overactive immune system. First, based\non data from Vav1–/– mouse models [4,5,108] and human CRISPR-Cas9 screening [6,109]\nshowing a key role for VAV1 in TCR and CD28 signaling and cytokine production (discussed\nabove), targeting VAV1 might affect the priming, expansion, and differentiation of Th subsets\nand associated cytokines in peripheral lymphoid organs (Figure 4A). Reductions in immunoglob-\nulin (Ig)-class switching and impaired BCR-mediated signaling and B cell proliferation in Vav1–/–\nmice [5,110] also suggest that targeting VAV1 would regulate BCR-mediated antibody re-\nsponses or T cell-mediated support of B cell responses. Second, it appears that the primary\nGEF-dependent function of VAV1 is to preferentially activate Rac1 [11,26,33,34], a key regulator\nof actin polymerization and cytoskeleton reorganization (at least in T cells) [4,5]. This points to a\nrole for VAV1 in not only immunological synapse formation, but also, as mentioned, cell adhesion,\nrolling, and diapedesis (Figure 4B). This is relevant because it hypothetically suggests that\ntargeting VAV1 would help regulate trafﬁcking and transmigration of T cells and, potentially,\nother VAV1-expressing cell types to sites of inﬂammation and disease. Finally, we hypothesize\nthat therapeutic targeting of VAV1 in diseased tissues might block antigen-mediated reactivation\nof self-reactive T cells and the secretion of proinﬂammatory cytokines driving inﬂammation, tissue\ndamage, and disease progression (Figure 4C). As discussed, mouse models of arthritis and EAE\nindicate that loss/suppression of VAV1 might restrict tissue-speciﬁc autoimmunity, slowing dis-\nease onset/progression [40,46,49,51]. Thus, targeting VAV1 may lead to attenuation of key path-\nogenic immune cell subsets across both arms of the adaptive immune system.\n\nOptions for VAV1-based therapeutic interventions\nDespite being a preclinically validated target for T and T/B cell-mediated diseases, such as AIA\nand EAE [40,49], the dual GEF-dependent and -independent functions of VAV1 have remained\n‘undruggable’. Thiopurine metabolites/analogs interfere with GEF function, but do not directly\nor selectively target VAV1 [63,106,107]. Directly targeting GEF active domains, such as those\nfound in VAV1, has proven challenging for drug discovery; the design of small-molecule modula-\ntors that target large multidomain proteins lacking clearly deﬁned binding pockets is difﬁcult [2].\nPreliminary reports of the genetic sequence and crystal structure of a VAV1 allosteric inhibitoriii\nsuggest that targeting GEF function allosterically is possible, but further research is required. Re-\nlease of autoinhibition is an absolute requirement for VAV1 activation [3]. Thus, any agent de-\nsigned to bind VAV1 through the domains constituting its catalytic (GEF) function would require\nVAV1 to be activated to make binding sites available. Moreover, therapeutic approaches that in-\nterfere exclusively with GEF function might, hypothetically, preserve VAV1 scaffolding functions,\n\nTrends in Immunology, Month 2024, Vol. xx, No. xx\n\n13"

Given these limitations, interventions that seek to\neliminate total protein function may be more effective compared with active site inactivation.\n\nWhich therapeutic modalities might target VAV1 expression/function? Building on the activity of\nazathioprine, more speciﬁc designer thiopurine analogs may offer new avenues for VAV1/Rac1\npathway blockade [63], but are yet to be tested in clinical trials. Another emerging modality is\ntargeted VAV1 protein degradation, which might be used to harness the ubiquitin-proteosome\nsystem in the body, a natural process that regulates protein quality and homeostasis. Novel tech-\nniques for degrading and eliminating disease-causing proteins are being investigated [111]. Re-\ncent progress toward modulators of previously ‘undruggable’ proteins [2] has been made by\nusing strategies, such as protein–protein interaction disruptors or proteolysis targeting chi-\nmera (PROTAC) degraders, to, for example, modulate the GEF Son of sevenless homolog 1\n[112]. A PROTAC degrader requires moieties capable of binding simultaneously to the target pro-\ntein through a distinct binding pocket and to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to ubiquitination of the\nformer and its subsequent removal from the cell [111]. While effective, this modality poses chal-\nlenges for proteins such as VAV1, which lack obvious binding pockets.\n\nNotably, molecular glue degraders (MGDs) are oral small molecules that can bind to, and induce\nstructural changes in, the surface of E3 ligase complexes, driving interaction with, and subsequent\nubiquitination of, novel protein targets and earmarking them for degradation [111]. Recent data on\na VAV1-targeting MGD, MRT-6160, which is in development for autoimmune and inﬂammatory dis-\neases, such as IBD and RA, report successful and speciﬁc degradation of VAV1 in vitro and in vivo, as\nwell as in vitro attenuation of TCR/BCR-mediated activation in primary human T/B lymphocytes, and\ninhibition of T cell proliferation, and cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner [113,114]. In\nvivo, orally administered MRT-6160 demonstrates promising preclinical activity in mouse models of\nT and T/B cell-mediated disease, inhibiting disease progression in collagen-induced arthritis [113]\nand colitis [114]. These studies also report that MRT-6160 inhibits disease progression concomitant\nwith reductions in: IL-17+ and TNF+ CD4+ T cells [114,115]; proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF)\nin the serum [113] or diseased tissues [114,115]; autoantibody production [113]; and expression of\nkey markers of disease severity [113,114].\n\nFinally, advances in RNA interference (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy) offer the\npotential to target VAV1 mRNA expression and block protein translation [116], although this re-\nmains to be investigated. However, selectivity for VAV1 (particularly over VAV2/3), dosing ﬂexibil-\nity, and treatment accessibility are important considerations.\n\nConcluding remarks\nAlthough the efﬁcacy and safety of any treatment modality targeting VAV1 remain to be determined\nin humans (see Outstanding questions), we hypothesize that such interventions may have thera-\npeutic potential to regulate T and T/B cell-mediated autoimmunity and chronic inﬂammation for cer-\ntain pathologies. Loss/mutation of Vav1 can successfully abrogate inﬂammation, tissue damage,\nand disease progression in mouse models of arthritis and EAE [40,46,49,51]. However, the use\nof germline knockouts (where disruption of early T cell development might impact mature effector\nlymphocyte function), and the lack of inducible systems or other methods to target the protein in\nmature animals, clearly limit extrapolation of these data to adult human diseases. Certain preclinical\nstudies in models of arthritis [113] and colitis [114] have provided promising exploratory results\nsupporting the total attenuation of VAV1 function through protein degradation as one possible ther-\napeutic approach. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these MOA in humans must be established in\nrandomized controlled clinical trials before targeting VAV1 can be considered a viable option for\ntreating certain autoimmune or inﬂammatory conditions.\n\n14\n\nTrends in Immunology, Month 2024, Vol. xx, No. xx\n\nviable\n\nclinical\n\nand/or\n\nautoimmune\n\nOutstanding questions\ntarget\nIs VAV1 a\nin\nchronic\ninﬂammatory diseases? While there is\nstrong evidence of a key role for VAV1 in\nand\nantigen\ninvolvement in T and T/B cell-mediated\npathology, the efﬁcacy of agents targeting\nVAV1 must be determined in randomized\ncontrolled clinical trials.\n\nsignaling,\n\nreceptor\n\nand\n\ninfections,\n\nCan targeting VAV1 be safe? All available\ndrugs with potent immunomodulatory\ncapabilities have some increased risk\nincluding serious and\nof\ninfection,\nopportunistic\nan\ninherent, albeit small, risk of malignancy,\nparticularly in the presence of certain\nrisk factors (older age and smoking).\nThe risk of serious and opportunistic\ninfections, such as C. albicans, as well\nas other adverse outcomes in response\nto agents targeting VAV1 must be\ninvestigated.\n\nVAV1\n\ntargeting\n\nHow will\naffect\nproinﬂammatory cytokine production in\npatients? The exact role of VAV1 in Th1/\nTh2/Th17 differentiation and cytokine\nproduction requires further investigation.\n\nWill\ntargeting VAV1 affect other\nhematopoietic cells? The risk:beneﬁt\nratio of targeting VAV1 in different cell\ntypes must be carefully determined.\nMany autoimmune/chronic inﬂammatory\ndisorders are heterogenous in etiology;\nto date, there is no ‘one size ﬁts all’\napproach in terms of effective drug\ntarget multiple\nMOA. Agents that\naspects of\nthe adaptive and innate\nimmune systems could have broader\nthan expected therapeutic beneﬁts.\n\nWill targeting VAV1 show efﬁcacy in other\nimmune-mediated conditions? Although\na detailed review was beyond the\nscope of this article, research shows a\npivotal role for VAV1 in oncology [117].\nBTK, an essential component of BCR\nsignaling that physically associates with\nVAV1 [118], is a major therapeutic target\nin oncology and an investigational target\nin autoimmune disease [119]. Studies\nalso link VAV1, as a positive regulator of\nT cell\nfunction, with allograft survival\n[120]. The efﬁcacy/safety of targeting\nVAV1 in patients with cancer or those un-\ndergoing transplantation remains to be\nfully elucidated."

In vivo, MRT-\n2359 was efficacious upon continuous daily (QD) or intermittent (5 days on / 9 days off) administration. MRT-2359 at 10 \nmg/kg QD led to full tumor regression (TV = 0), and there was no sign of tumor regrowth 35 days after treatment cessation. \nAs expected, enzalutamide was not active in this model, and it did not contribute to efficacy in combination with MRT-2359.\n\nActivity of MRT-2359 in NE or AR negative /c-MYC low prostate cancer models\n\nIn vitro profiling indicated limited MRT-2359 sensitivity in AR negative / c-MYC low prostate cancer cell lines, whereas the \nsensitivity of a NE prostate cancer cell line was unclear. Therefore, MRT-2359 in vivo activity was assessed in subcutaneous \nxenograft models of the NE cell line NCI-H660 (1) or the AR negative / c-MYC low cell line PC3 (2).\n\n1\n\n)\n\nM\nE\nS\n±\nn\na\ne\nm\n\n,\n3\nm\nm\n\nl\n\n(\ne\nm\nu\no\nv\nr\no\nm\nu\nT\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNCI-H660\nneuroendocrine\n\nno further treatment\n\nVehicle\nMRT-2359, 10 mg/kg QD\nMRT-2359, 3 mg/kg 5 days on / 9 days off\nMRT-2359, 10 mg/kg 5 days on / 9 days off\nMRT-2359, 30 mg/kg 5 days on / 9 days off\n\n2\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n)\n\nM\nE\nS\n±\nn\na\ne\nm\n\nPC3\nAR negative / c-MYC low\n\nVehicle\n\nMRT-2359, 10 mg/kg QD\n\nMRT-2359, 10 mg/kg\n5 days on / 9 days off\n\nTV = 0 in 9/9 mice treated with \nMRT-2359 at 10 mg/kg QD\n\n50\n\n10\nTime post treatment initiation (days)\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n,\n3\nm\nm\n\nl\n\n(\ne\nm\nu\no\nv\nr\no\nm\nu\nT\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nTime post treatment initiation (days)\n\nNCI-H660, regression (%) on day 28: MRT-2359, 10 mg/kg QD, -100; 3 mg/kg 5 days on / 9 days off: -7; 10 mg/kg 5 days on / 9 days off, -78.  Abbreviations: as above; NE, neuroendocrine.\n\nDespite apparent moderate maximal effect in a 3-day in vitro assay, MRT-2359 led to profound regression of NCI-H660 \nxenografts in vivo.

The top 2 positively enriched sets are shown above. An \nenrichment plot for the KEGG ribosome gene set is shown on the \nright. Similar enrichment was observed for ”mTOR dependent” \ngenes (Hsieh et al, Nature 2012 and Park et al, Cell Reports 2017; \ngene sets are not part of  MSigDB).\n\nAbbreviations: GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; NES, \nnormalized enrichment score.\n\n• Besides androgen receptor \n\nexpression and activity, sensitive \nprostate cancer cell lines are \ncharacterized by high expression of \nribosomal genes.\n\n• This observation suggests an altered \n\nstate of global translation (see \n“Introduction”), potentially linked to \nhigh c-MYC, leading to increased \nsensitivity to translation blockade via \nGSPT1 degradation.\n\nSummary and Future Development\n\n•\n\nIn vitro cancer cell line profiling of the GSPT1 MGD MRT-2359 revealed marked sensitivity in a subset of \nprostate cancer cell lines associated with readily measurable biomarker candidates (AR + c-MYC or NE).\n\n• Treatment of MRT-2359 sensitive prostate cancer cell lines in vitro led to a loss of c-MYC and, to a lesser \n\nextent, AR (including AR-V7) proteins.\n\n• Marked tumor regression upon treatment with MRT-2359 as single agent was observed in three cell line \n\nderived xenograft models that were positive for the biomarker candidates discovered in vitro, but no efficacy \nwas seen in a biomarker negative xenograft model.\n\n•\n\nIn an AR positive model with minimal expression of the variant AR-V7, combinations of MRT-2359 and \nenzalutamide were more efficacious than the respective single agent treatments.\n\n• These data warrant clinical investigation of MRT-2359 as single agent or in combination with an AR \n\nantagonist in patients with prostate cancer.\n\nReferences: 1.

images: 10X; scale bar: 300µm\n\nNot treated\n\n1uM MRT-50969\n\nNot treated\n\n1uM MRT-50969\n\n• Cellular effects of cyclin E1 degradation in CCNE1-amplified cancer cell lines include suppression of RB \n\nphosphorylation and E2F targets, growth arrest associated with G1 cell cycle arrest and ablation of S phase, and \ninduction of senescence.\n\n• RB knockout prevents growth arrest and senescence, suggesting that the major cellular effect of cyclin E1 in \n\nCCNE1-amplified cell lines is mediating RB phosphorylation in complex with CDK2.\n\n• When profiled across a larger panel of ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer cell lines, MRT-50969 activity \nrecapitulates genetic CCNE1 dependencies and is associated with CCNE1 mRNA expression and copy number.\n\n• Unlike MRT-50969, several tested clinical CDK2 or WEE1 inhibitors did not fully recapitulate genetic dependency, \n\npotentially indicating off-target activity.\n\n• MRT-50969 is orally bioavailable and shows anti-tumor activity in a dose dependent manner in \n\nCCNE1-amplified cell line-derived xenograft models.\n\n• Cyclin E1 MGDs represent a paradigm shift due to their potential to directly target a frequently \n\namplified non-enzymatic driver oncogene with unprecedented selectivity in a population of cancer \npatients with high unmet medical need. \n\nAll authors are employees of Monte Rosa Therapeutics.\n\nLink to PDF above.

induces the degradation of GSPT1, the associated downregulation of N-MYC and the modulation of its\ntranscriptional output leading to preferential anti-proliferative activity in L-MYC and N-MYC driven cancer cells\n• MRT-2359 administered orally demonstrates preferential anti-tumor activity in xenograft and PDX NSCLC models\n\nwith high L-MYC and/or N-MYC mRNA expression levels\n\n• Patient sample analyses indicate that 15% of NSCLC and 72% of SCLC have high L-MYC and/or N-MYC expression\n• Taken together these data warrant the clinical development of MRT-2359 in MYC-driven solid tumors addicted to\n\nprotein translation with a focus on NSCLC, SCLC and neuroendocrine lung cancer\n\nCopies of this poster are for personal, noncommercial use only and are not to be published in any

All  statements  other  than  statements  of  historical  facts  contained  in  this  presentation, \nincluding  express  or  implied  statements  regarding  our  strategy,  future  financial  condition,  future  operations,  projected  costs,  prospects,  plans,  objectives  of  management  and  expected \nmarket growth, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  ‘‘anticipate,’’ “upcoming,” ‘‘assume,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘could,’’  \n‘‘estimate,’’  ‘‘expect,’’  ‘‘goal,’’  ‘‘intend,’’  ‘‘may,’’  “milestones,”  ‘‘objective,’’  ‘‘plan,’’  ‘‘predict,’’  ‘‘potential,’’  ‘‘seek,’’  ‘‘should,’’  ‘‘target,’’  ‘‘will,’’  ‘‘would’’  and  other  similar  expressions  that  are \npredictions  of  or  indicate  future  events  and  future  trends,  or  the  negative  of  these  terms  or  other  comparable  terminology.  We  may  not  actually  achieve  the  plans,  intentions  or \nexpectations  disclosed  in  our  forward-looking  statements,  and  you  should  not  place  undue  reliance  on  our  forward-looking  statements.  You  should  not  rely  upon  forward-looking \nstatements as predictions of future events and actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed herein.  \n\nAny  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on management's  current expectations  and beliefs  and  are  subject  to  a  number  of  risks,  uncertainties and  important  factors  that  may  cause \nactual  events  or  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  or  implied  by  any  forward-looking  statements  including,  without  limitation,  risks  associated  with:  the  timing  and \nanticipated  results  of  our  current  and  future preclinical studies and  clinical  trials, supply  chain, strategy and  future  operations;  the delay  of  any  current  and  future preclinical  studies  or \nclinical trials or the development of our drug candidates; the risk that the results of prior preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future results in connection with \ncurrent or future preclinical studies and clinical trials, including those for KT-474/SAR-444656, KT-621 and KT-579; the risk that cross-trial comparisons may not be reliable as no head-to-\nhead trials have been conducted comparing KT-621 to dupilumab, and Phase 1 clinical data for KT-621 may not be directly comparable to dupilumab’s clinical data due to differences in \nmolecule composition, trial protocols, dosing regimens, and patient populations and characteristics; our ability to successfully demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates; \nthe  timing  and  outcome  of  any  interactions  with  regulatory  authorities;  obtaining,  maintaining  and  protecting  our  intellectual  property;  our  relationships  with  existing  and  future \ncollaboration partners; the impacts of current macroeconomic and geopolitical events. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent Kymera’s views only as of today and should \nnot be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. Kymera explicitly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. No \nrepresentations or warranties (expressed or implied) are made about the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements. As a result of these risks and others, including those set forth in \nour filings with the SEC, actual results could vary significantly from those anticipated in this presentation, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely \naffected.  \n\nCertain information contained in this presentation and statements made orally during this presentation relate to or is based on studies, publications, surveys and other data obtained from \nthird-party sources and the Company’s own internal estimates and research. No head-to-head trials have been conducted comparing KT-621 to dupilumab. Phase 1 clinical data for KT-\n621 may not be directly comparable to dupilumab’s clinical data due to differences in molecule composition, trial protocols, dosing regimens, and patient populations and characteristics. \nAccordingly, cross-trial comparisons may not be reliable. While the Company believes these third-party studies, publications, surveys and other data to be reliable as of the date of the \npresentation, it has not independently verified, and makes no representation as to the adequacy, fairness, accuracy or completeness of, any information obtained from third-party sources. \nIn addition, no independent sources have evaluated the reasonableness or accuracy of the Company’s internal estimates or research, and no reliance should be made on any information or \nstatements  made  in  this  presentation  relating  to  or  based  on  such  internal  estimates  and  research.

CFT1946 induces \nternary complex \nformation with BRAF \nand cereblon E3 ligase \n(step 1)\n\nii. BRAF V600 is \n\nubiquitinated and \nsubsequently released \nfor degradation in \nthe proteasome \n(steps 2-4)\n\n• CFT1946 has demonstrated \npreclinical activity in BRAF \nV600 mutant in vitro and \nin vivo models, including \nmodels resistant to BRAFi\n(Figures 3-5)\n\nPRE-CLINICAL DATA: IN VITRO\n\nFigure 3: CFT1946 Is an On-Mechanism, CRBN-Based, Highly Selective BRAF V600X \nBiDAC™ Degrader5\n\nA.\n\nCFT1946 Degrades \nBRAF V600E in a Dose-\nDependent Manner\n\nB.\n\nCFT1946 is an \nOn-Mechanism \nBiDAC™ Degrader\n\nC.\n\nProteome Profiling \nDemonstrates Selectivity of \nCFT1946 for BRAF V600E\n\nCFT1946 (100 nM) in A375 cells @ 24 h\n\nDC50 = 14 nM\nEmax = 26%\n\nBRAFV600E\n\nVinculin\n\n*note: +/- refers to presence or absence of 100 nM CFT1946\n\n• CFT1946 acts as both an inhibitor and a degrader of BRAF V600E as demonstrated in HiBiT assay in panel A. \n\nPhospho-ERK levels decrease in a CFT1946 dose-dependent manner. BRAF V600E levels decrease in a CFT1946 \ndose-dependent manner until “hook effect” concentrations are achieved. Panel B demonstrates that CFT1946 is \non-mechanism for a CRBN-based BiDAC™ degrader and Panel C shows the selectivity of CFT1946 in A375 cells \nusing global proteomic profiling.\n\nPRE-CLINICAL DATA: IN VIVO (continued)\nFigure 5: CFT1946 Induces Tumor Regression in the A375 (homozygous \nBRAF V600E) Xenograft Mouse Model as a Single Agent and in Combination \nWith the MEK Inhibitor, Trametinib, in a BRAF Inhibitor-Resistant Xenograft \nMouse Model5\n\nA.\n\nCFT1946 Treatment of A375 Cell Line In Vivo Shows Dose-Dependent \nTumor Regression Superior to Inhibitor\n\nKEY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA6\n\nKEY INCLUSION CRITERIA\n• ≥18 years of age at time of informed consent\n• Documented evidence of a BRAF V600 \n\nmutation obtained from tumor tissue or \nliquid biopsy\n\n• Received ≥1 prior line of SoC therapy for \n\nunresectable locally advanced or metastatic \ndisease, NSCLC, CRC, ATC or other BRAF V600 \nmutation-positive tumors\n\n• Adequate bone marrow, liver, renal, and \n\ncardiac organ function\n\nKEY EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nSubject has had major surgery within 21 days prior \nto the planned first dose.

As CFT1946 degrades BRAF V600 \nmutant protein and results in decreases phospho-ERK levels, some MAPK pathway inhibition occurs prior to \nmaximal loss of BRAF V600E protein.\n\n*CFT1946 is administered orally in 28-day cycles until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. \n†Phase 2 will be initiated once the RP2D has been identified. Eligible subjects are ≥18 years-old with documented BRAF V600 mutant cancers who have received \n≥1 prior therapy. \n‡Phase 2 expansion study design will be updated based on Health Authority feedback.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the site support staff, study sponsor, \nand collaborators as well as participating patients and their \nfamilies for their contributions to the study.

Pollock, Michael Thomenius C4 Therapeutics, Inc., Watertown, MA USA\n\nAbstract # 411\n\nIntroduction\n\nImmunomodulatory drugs, such as pomalidomide and lenalidomide are approved for the\ntreatment of multiple subtypes of NHL. These drugs induce an interaction between Ikaros\nfamily zinc finger proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1/3) and cereblon (CRBN), an E3 ligase, resulting in\nIKZF1/3 are master transcription factors that are essential for viability\nIKZF1/3 degradation.\nof non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Clinically, immunomodulatory drugs are active as single\nagents and when used in combination with several classes of targeted therapies, in both\nfirst line and relapsed/refractory NHL subtypes.\n\nWe previously described the preclinical characterization of CFT7455 as a novel IKZF1/3\ndegrader with 800-1600-fold increased potency over pomalidomide in CRBN binding and\ncellular IKZF1 degradation assays. We demonstrated that this increased activity translates\ninto dramatically greater efficacy compared to pomalidomide in cellular and in vivo\npreclinical models of multiple myeloma and NHL. Here we show that the increased catalytic\nactivity and improved potency of CFT7455 also translates into potent anti-tumor activity as\na single agent or in combination with clinically approved agents in multiple models of NHL.\nIn both the Raji and OCI-Ly10 CNS xenograft models, CFT7455 (100 µg/kg/day) led to a\nsignificant increase in survival probability in comparison to pomalidomide (3000 µg/kg/day)\n(P=0.002, P=0.0002).\n\nThe combination of immunomodulatory drugs with CD20, BTK, or HDAC targeting agents\nshows promising clinical activity in the treatment of NHL. Combination studies were\nconducted in which CFT7455 was dosed together with rituximab (anti-CD20\nantibody), ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor), or romidepsin (HDAC inhibitor) in several models of NHL.\nIn the mantle cell\nlymphoma (MCL) model, Mino, the combination of CFT7455 with\nrituximab demonstrated enhanced activity and complete tumor regression. In the diffuse\nlarge B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) model, TMD8, the combination of ibrutinib and CFT7455 was\nsynergistic and resulted in a significant increase in survival probability . Synergistic activity\nwas also observed with the combination of CFT7455 and romidepsin in two models of ALCL.\nIn the intracranial NHL model, OCI-Ly10, the combination of CFT7455 with rituximab or\nibrutinib also led to a significant increase in survival probability, highlighting the therapeutic\npotential of this combination in CNS disease. In conclusion, CFT7455 is a potent, selective\ncatalytic degrader of IKZF1/3, with single agent and combination antitumor activity in\nDLBCL, ALCL, and MCL, supporting clinical investigation of CFT7455 for NHL.\n\nCFT7455 Targets IKZF1 (Ikaros) \nand IKZF3 (Aiolos) Dependent Lymphomas \n\nA.\n\nB.\n\nPrecursor \nTCL\n\nThymus\n\nIKZF1/3 \nDependent\n\nPTCL/ALCL\n\nLymph node\n\nPrecursor \nBCL\n\nNHL\nMCL, DLBCL, \nFL, MZL\n\nFigure 1.

As a result, IKZF1/3 are\nubiquitinated by the CRBN E3 ligase and degraded by the proteasome, resulting in the death of cells\ndependent on IKZF1/3, including subsets of lymphoma and multiple myeloma.\n\nCFT7455 Displays High Affinity CRBN Binding \nand Potent, Deep IKZF1 Degradation \n\nA.\n\nB.\n\nC.\n\nKd = 0.9 nM\n\nKd = 712 nM\n\nIC50 = 0.4 nM\n\nIC50 = 644 nM\n\nFigure 2: Binding properties and in vitro degradation kinetics for CFT7455 and pomalidomide\n\nA.

CFT8634 induces ternary complex formation with BRD9 and cereblon E3 ligase \n\n(step 1)\n\nii. BRD9 is ubiquitinated and subsequently released for degradation in the \n\nproteasome (steps 2-4)\n\n• CFT8634 leads to robust and dose-dependent degradation of BRD9 in in vitro and in \n\nvivo models of SMARCB1-perturbed cancer, which translates to significant and \ndose-dependent anti-tumor activity in patient-derived preclinical xenograft models \n(Figures 2)\n\nPRE-CLINICAL DATA: IN VIVO IN PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFTS (PDX)5\n\nFigure 2: Robust Efficacy Response Observed in Two PDX Models of Synovial Sarcoma5\n\nA.

Modeling Based on Initial Dosing Schedule\n\nFigure 10B. Modeling Based on Planned Dosing Schedule\n\nSIMULATION DATA\n• Due to the observed PK in animal \nmodels and the observed clinical \npotency of single agent CFT7455 in \nthe setting of neutropenia, an \nalternative dosing regimen may \nincrease the therapeutic index\n\n• Different potential dosing regimens \n\nwere simulated using a PK-PD \nmodel developed based on the \nclinical PK data (Figure 6) and \nmouse xenograft data for IKZF3 \ndegradation in tumor (Figure 2B)\n\n• Figure 10A suggests that due to drug accumulation and prolonged half-life, there is insufficient time for neutrophil recovery during the 21 days on, \n\n7 days off dosing schedule.\n\n• Dosing 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off (Figure 10B) may facilitate neutrophil maturation and recovery while achieving sufficient target degradation to \n\nmaintain efficacy\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n• Preclinically, single-agent CFT7455 demonstrates increased activity in vivo in comparison to CC-92480\n\n‒ CFT7455 has longer exposure compared to CC-92480, resulting in sustained IKZF1/3 degradation in preclinical models\n‒ After 21 days of QD dosing, CFT7455 100 μg/kg/day resulted in durable tumor regressions for a prolonged period after drug discontinuation\n• Clinically, CFT7455 was rapidly absorbed with a plasma T1/2 of approximately 2 days; accumulation of drug was observed up to 4-fold by day 15 \n\nand achieved exposures at 50 µg that are equivalent to predicted efficacious exposures from nonclinical studies\n\n• Neutropenia was observed, including 3 patients with Grade 4 neutropenia resulting in two DLTs\n• Early pharmacodynamic data suggests a deep degradation of the primary targets, IKZF1 and IKZF3, at lower plasma exposure levels than initially projected\n• Preliminary evidence of single-agent CFT7455 activity was observed in this cohort of heavily pretreated patients, including meaningful decreases in dFLC\n• Modeling of this data set suggests that alternative dosing regimens may increase the therapeutic index by allowing time for adequate neutrophil \n\nmaturation during the days off drug while maximizing the efficacy potential of single-agent CFT7455\n\n• Due to the greater-than-expected differentiated and potent pharmacologic properties observed, patients are currently being enrolled in Cohorts B1 and C \n\nof the clinical study on alternative dosing regimens\n\n1Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA; 2Department of Medicine, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; 3Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, Denver, CO; \n4Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA; 5Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; 6Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; 7University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; 8Division of Hematology, \nMayo Clinic Rochester, Saint Paul, MN; 9Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL; 10Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Ctr, Boston, MA; 11Levine L.

Reilly, Jacob Stephenson, Mathew E. Sowa, Samantha Perino, Laura L. Poling, Eunju Hurh, Michael Thomenius, Yanke Liang, Stewart L. Fisher, and Roy M. Pollock \nC4 Therapeutics, Inc., Watertown, MA.\n\n#1658\n\nAbstract\n\nActivating mutations in BRAF at residue V600 (typically V600E) lead to dysregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway and occur \nin  approximately  8%  of  all  human  cancers,  including  60%  of  melanoma,  up  to  12%  of  CRC,  and  4%  of  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  Currently \napproved  BRAF  inhibitors  (BRAFi)  are  selective  for  BRAF  V600X  mutant  proteins  and  are  typically  used  in  combination  with  MEK  inhibitors  (MEKi)  in \nmelanoma  and  NSCLC,  or  anti-EGFR  antibodies  such  as  cetuximab  in  CRC.  However,  their  activity  is  limited  by  primary  or  acquired  resistance  often \nmediated by RAF dimer-inducing mechanisms. Furthermore, progression of BRAF V600X melanoma after BRAFi/MEKi treatment frequently involves brain \nmetastasis, and currently approved BRAFi have relatively poor brain penetration. \n\nCFT1946 is a potent, orally bioavailable, cereblon-based BiDACTM degrader that selectively degrades BRAF V600X mutant protein and is currently under \ninvestigation in a Phase I clinical trial. CFT1946, by degrading V600X, abrogates resistance and paradoxical activation associated with RAF dimerization as \nseen with approved inhibitors. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that CFT1946 is efficacious in an A375 BRAF V600E/NRAS Q61K xenograft model \nof BRAFi resistant melanoma (AACR; Cancer Research, (2023) 3425 and (2022) 2158)\n\nHere we substantially expand our preclinical characterization of CFT1946 across multiple models of BRAF V600X-driven cancers including BRAF V600X-\ndriven CRC and NSCLC, additional BRAFi-resistant melanoma models, and a brain metastatic melanoma model. Single agent CFT1946 outperformed the \nstandard of care (SOC) encorafenib (BRAF inhibitor) + cetuximab (EGFR mAb) combination in a panel of BRAF V600X CRC xenograft models. CFT1946 also \ndemonstrated single agent regression in a BRAF V600X NSCLC PDX model where the SOC dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) + trametinib (MEK inhibitor) showed \nonly modest tumor growth inhibition.  Consistent with our previous results in the A375 melanoma model, single agent CFT1946 showed superior activity \nversus the SOC dabrafenib + trametinib combination in all additional melanoma models tested, with complete regression achieved using a CFT1946 + \ntrametinib combination in a PDX model bearing a BRAF V600E kinase duplication that showed minimal response to dabrafenib + trametinib. Finally, using \nan A375 intracranial model, single agent treatment with CFT1946 gave robust, dose-dependent efficacy and survival advantage over encorafenib.\n\nThe promising activity of CFT1946 in a broad range of BRAF V600X preclinical models supports its ongoing clinical investigation in BRAF V600X mutant \nsolid tumors (NCT05668585).\n\nModel for CFT1946 Efficacy in BRAF V600E Monomer and Dimer-Dependent Diseases \n\nCFT1946 is Superior to Clinically Approved BRAF Inhibitors in \nAdditional BRAF V600E Melanoma CDX and PDX Models\nB\n\nA\n\nC\n\nE\n\nD\n\nFigure  2.

CFT1946  prolongs  survival  in  an  intracranial  model  of  metastatic \nmelanoma.  (A)  Female  BALBc/Nude  mice  underwent  intracranial  surgical \nimplantation  of  A375-luciferase  cells  in  20%  Matrigel.  Kaplan  Meier  Survival \ncurve  demonstrates  survival  in  response  to  treatment  with  encorafenib  (35 \nmg/kg,  PO/QD)  or  CFT1946  (10  mg/kg,  or  30  mg/kg,  PO/BID).  At  120  Days \n(dotted  line)  treatment  was  discontinued,  and  the  remaining  mice  were \nmonitored  for  tumor  burden,  weight  loss,  and  survival.  All  doses  were  well-\ntolerated as no group showed more than mean 10% body weight loss before \ndetectible  tumor  signal.  Mice  were  terminated  when  they  reached  20% \nweight  loss  due  to  tumor  burden.  (B)  Luminescence  signal  graphed  for \nindividual  mice  on  study,  representing  tumor  burden.  (C)  Representative \nimages  of  luminescence  signal,  depicting  progression  of  individual  mice  for \neach  treatment  arm  at  representative  timepoints.  (D)  Pharmacokinetics  of \nmouse  plasma  (left)  and  brain  tumor  (right)  demonstrate  brain  exposure  of \nCFT1946  and  encorafenib  (*encorafenib  was  below  quantifiable  level  after  1 \nhour). Compounds in the study were dosed orally QD or BID as indicated, n=8 \nmice per arm.\n\nFigure  5.  CFT1946  single  agent  treatment  is  superior  to  SOC  in  CRC  models.  (A)  In  vivo  efficacy  of  CFT1946  or  encorafenib  with  or  without  cetuximab  combination \ndemonstrates degrader advantage in the BRAF V600E heterozygous colorectal carcinoma model HT-29, microsatellite stable (MSS) model. (B) Representative images of \ntumor  tissue  collected  at  end  of  study  at  20x  magnification  with  quantified  levels  of  phosphorylated  ERK  displayed  as  H-scores  in  image  panels.  CFT1946  treatment \nresults  in  greater  suppression  of  pERK  than  the  inhibitor  or  cetuximab  alone,  CFT1946  in  combination  with  cetuximab  has  the  greatest  pERK  suppression  by  IHC, \ncorrelating with the deepest level of tumor growth inhibition in the efficacy study. (C) Corresponding end of study tumor BRAF V600E protein levels from efficacy study \ndemonstrate BRAF degradation in CFT1946 treated mice. (D) Live imaging of cellular confluency over 10 days was captured for HT-29 cells in the presence of CFT1946 or \nencorafenib with or without cetuximab combination. (E) Efficacy study of the BRAF V600E CRC model Colo205, an MSS model known to be sensitive to BRAF inhibitor \ntreatment. Treatment was ceased at day 21 and monitored for outgrowth, CFT1946 treatment resulted in a more durable suppression of tumor growth with tumors still \nundetectable 14 days after removal of treatment for 7 out of 8 mice. (F) In vivo efficacy study with the microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC model LS411N demonstrated \nstrong tumor growth inhibition with CFT1946 treatment and further suppression of tumor growth with addition of cetuximab. (G) CFT1946 treatment in the MSI CRC \nmodel  RKO  suppressed  tumor  growth  but  was  not  further  benefited  by  addition  of  cetuximab.  Compounds  in  efficacy  studies  were  dosed  orally  QD,  Q3D,  or  BID  as \nindicated. Efficacy data are expressed as mean tumor volumes ± SEM. \n\nSummary\n\nCFT1946, a potent and selective orally bioavailable BRAF V600X BiDAC degrader, is:\n• superior to SOC BRAFi treatment in multiple BRAF V600X mutant melanoma PDX and CDX models, \n\nincluding BRAFi resistant models\n\n• superior to SOC BRAFi/MEKi treatment in a BRAF V600X mutant NSCLC PDX model\n• superior to SOC BRAFi treatment in a BRAF V600X mutant intracranial metastatic melanoma model\n• superior to SOC BRAFi/EGFRmAb treatment in multiple BRAF V600X mutant CRC CDX models\n\nTaken together, our data demonstrate that degradation of BRAF V600X mutants by CFT1946, in \nmonomer and dimer-driven settings, offers the potential to treat patients with a broad range of BRAF \nV600X mutant-driven cancers including melanoma, NSCLC, and CRC.\n\nThese data provide encouraging support of the ongoing clinical investigation of CFT1946 in BRAF V600 \nmutant solid tumors (NCT05668585).\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n\nPoulikakos, Poulikos I et al. “RAF inhibitors transactivate RAF dimers and ERK signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF.” Nature vol. 464,7287 (2010): 427-30. doi:10.1038/nature08902\nCorcoran, Ryan B et al. “EGFR-mediated re-activation of MAPK signaling contributes to insensitivity of BRAF mutant colorectal cancers to RAF inhibition with vemurafenib.” Cancer \ndiscovery vol. 2,3 (2012): 227-35. doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0341\nYao, Zhan et al. “RAF inhibitor PLX8394 selectively disrupts BRAF dimers and RAS-independent BRAF-mutant-driven signaling.” Nature medicine vol. 25,2 (2019): 284-291. \ndoi:10.1038/s41591-018-0274-5\n\n07142128350500100015002000Days on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)Vehicleencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QDCFT1946, 0.3 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 3 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDA37507142105001000150020002500Days on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)VehicleMEKi: trametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDencorafenib,35 mg/kg, QD + MEKi BIDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 30 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg  + MEKi, BIDCFT1946, 30 mg/kg + MEKi, BIDA375 NRAS Q61K03060901201500255075100A375 BRAF V600E-Luc Intracranial ModelDays on StudySurvival PercentageEnd ofTreatment0255075100Days%Cell  ConfluencyDMSOencorafenib 0.1 µMCFT1946 0.1 µMCFT1946 0.1 µM, cetuximab 10 µg/mlencorafenib 0.1 µM, cetuximab 10 µg/mlcetuximab 10 µg/ml2460810HT-2903060901201500Days on StudyPhotons/sec ( e10)Vehicleencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 30 mg/kg, BID0.51.01.5Luminescence Per MouseEnd of Treatment07142128354249025050075010001250SK-MEL-28BRAF V600E HomozygousDays of TreatmentTumor Volume (mm3)VehicleCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QD0714212835050010001500SK-MEL-24BRAF V600E HeterozygousDays of TreatmentTumor Volume (mm3)VehicleCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QD071421280100020003000A2058BRAF V600E HeterozygousMEK1 P124S HeterozygousDays on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)VehicleCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QDtrametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BID +trametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QD +trametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDDay 17 Trametinib 0.3 mg/kg071421025050075010001250HT-29 (MSS)Days on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)Vehiclecetuximab, 11 mg/kg, Q3Dencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QD + cetuximab, 11 mg/kg, Q3DCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BID + cetuximab, 11 mg/kg, Q3Dencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QD071421283502505007501000Colo205 (MSS)Days on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)End of Treatment071421050010001500LS411N (MSI)Days on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)0714212835420500100015002000NSCLC, BRAF V600EDays on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)VehicleCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDtrametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BID + trametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QD + trametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDEnd of Treatment0714210100020003000RKO (MSI)Days on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)Vehiclecetuximab, 11 mg/kg, Q3Dencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QDencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QD +cetuximab, 11 mg/kg, Q3DCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BID +cetuximab, 11 mg/kg, Q3D071421283542050010001500Days on StudyTumor Volume (mm3)Vehicletrametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QDCFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BID +trametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDdabrafenib, 100 mg/kg, QD +trametinib, 0.1 mg/kg, BIDBRAF V600E Kinase Domain Duplication PDXEnd of TreatmentVehiclecetuximabCFT1946CFT1946cetuximabencorafenibencorafenibcetuximab0.00.51.01.5Protein levelsHT-29Tumor BRAF V600E levels0.00.51.0Time (h)Protein levelsA2058Tumor BRAF V600E levels61224480.00.51.0Time (h)Protein levelsA2058Tumor pERK levels6122448CFT1946, 10 mg/kgdabrafenib, 100 mg/kgA375A375 + NRAS Q61K00.250.50.751expression relative to vehicleencorafenib,35 mg/kgVehicleCFT1946,10 mg/kgpERK in Tumor Tissue110100100010000100000Time (h)  Concentration (ng/mL)1122448Plasma PK1101001000Time (h)Concentration (ng/g)1122448CFT1946, 10 mg/kg, BIDCFT1946, 30 mg/kg, BIDencorafenib, 35 mg/kg, QDCNS Tumor PK***"

There were no Grade 5 AEs.\n\n– In 28 response-evaluable patients, durable and deepening responses were observed in a heavily pre-treated (3 median lines of \n\ntreatment) population of patients with WM, irrespective of CNS involvement, MYD88 or CXCR4 mutations:\n\n• A MRR of 60.7% and ORR of 75.0% was observed (including 3 VGPR and 14 PR), with 3 responses deepening from PR to \n\nVGPR with longer duration on treatment, and only one PD (3.6%) as best overall response.\n\n• Out of 3 patients with CNS involvement (2 with systemic disease), 2 have responded and none progressed.\n\n• A steady reduction in IgM levels occurred in most patients starting from the first IgM assessment (4 weeks), which continued to \n\ndeepen at 8 weeks and beyond (data shown on the poster). \n\n•\n\nThe median duration of response was not reached. 14 patients continued on treatment for more than 6 months.\n\n35\n\nAEs, adverse events; BTKi, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor; CNS, central nervous system; DLTs, dose-limiting toxicities; IgM, immunoglobulin M; MRR, major response rate; ORR, objective \nresponse rate; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; VGPR, very good partial response; TEAE, treatment-emergent AE; WM, Waldenström macroglobulinemia\n\nData cutoff: 19 Sep 2025"
